## Setup

To use the Nomad SDK, download the npm nomad-media-npm.

npm install nomad-media-npm
```

Then to import it, you can either use the default version, or the debug version. The difference is that the debug version isn't compressed and has more documentation and named parameters.

To use the default version use:

```javascript
import NomadMediaSDK from "nomad-media-npm";
```

To use the debug version user:

```javascript
import NomadMediaSDK from "nomad-media-npm/debug";
```

To initialize the sdk, call the NomadMediaSDK class as shown below:

```javascript
const SDK = NomadMediaSDK(config);
```

## Configure Environmental Variables

Follow this format for the config:

```
const config = {
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "serviceApiUrl": "serverApiUrl",
    "apiType": "admin",
    "debugMode": true
};
```

apiType: Specifies whether the function you are trying to run is **admin** or **portal**.

debugMode: Specifies when running functions, whether of not to print api call information.

You are now ready to use the SDK in your project.
